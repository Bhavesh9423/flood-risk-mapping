# 🌊 Flood Risk Identification System - India

## GIS and Remote Sensing Based Flood Prone Area Mapping

A web-based interactive mapping system for identifying and visualizing flood-prone districts in India using GIS analysis and remote sensing data.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This is a **Final Year Computer Engineering Project** that combines Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with web technologies to create an accessible, interactive flood risk visualization platform.

### 🎯 Objective
To identify and visualize flood-prone areas in India at the district level using weighted overlay analysis of multiple risk factors.

---

## 🔬 Methodology

### Data Sources & Risk Factors:
1. **Elevation Data (DEM)** - Digital Elevation Model
2. **Rainfall Data** - Historical precipitation patterns
3. **River Proximity** - Distance from major rivers and water bodies
4. **Land Use Pattern** - Urbanization and land cover analysis

### Analysis Technique:
- **Reclassification**: Each factor scored on 1-5 scale
- **Weighted Overlay Analysis**: Combined factors with appropriate weights
- **GIS Software**: QGIS for spatial analysis
- **Output**: Risk classification (High/Medium/Low)

---

## 🎨 Features

✅ **Interactive Map**: Pan, zoom, and explore flood risk across India  
✅ **Color-Coded Districts**:
   - 🔴 Red = High Risk
   - 🟠 Orange = Medium Risk
   - 🟢 Green = Low Risk

✅ **District Information**: Click any district for detailed risk information  
✅ **Legend & Info Panel**: Easy-to-understand risk classification  
✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices  
✅ **Fast Loading**: Optimized GeoJSON for quick performance

## 📊 GeoJSON Data Format

Your GeoJSON file should follow this structure:

```json
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "properties": {
        "district_name": "Mumbai",
        "state": "Maharashtra",
        "risk_level": "High"
      },
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [...]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Required Properties:
- `district_name` - Name of the district
- `state` - Name of the state
- `risk_level` - Must be: "High", "Medium", or "Low"
